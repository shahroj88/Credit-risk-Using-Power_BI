# Credit Risk Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a credit risk dataset using **Power BI** to understand loan default behavior and identify key risk factors. The dashboard provides insights into borrower segmentation, default trends, risk scoring, and scenario-based analysis using interactive visuals.

## 👤 Project Details
- **Name:** Shahroj  
- **Batch:** B9  
- **Tool Used:** Power BI Desktop  
- **Dataset:** Credit Risk Dataset (CSV)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze loan default patterns  
- Identify high-risk borrowers and loan segments  
- Understand the impact of interest rates on default behavior  
- Build an interactive and secure Power BI dashboard  

---

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard
- **KPI Cards:** Average Loan Amount, Average Interest Rate, Default Rate, Average Income, Loan-to-Income Ratio  
- **Loan Grade Analysis:** Interest rate, loan amount, and default rate by loan grade  
- **Borrower Segmentation:** Analysis by loan intent, employment length, and home ownership  
- **Time Series Analysis:** Default rate trend by credit history length  
- **What-if Analysis:** Simulation of default rate based on interest rate changes  
- **Risk Score Calculation:** Classification of loans into Low, Medium, and High risk  
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Role-based data access using loan intent  
- **Interactive Filters:** Slicers and navigation buttons for better usability

## 🧮 DAX & Analytics Used
- Average Loan Amount  
- Average Interest Rate  
- Default Rate (%)  
- Loan-to-Income Ratio  
- Simulated Default Rate (What-if Parameter)  
- Risk Score and Risk Category  

---

## 🔐 Security
Row Level Security (RLS) is implemented to restrict data visibility.  
Since region or department data was not available, **loan intent** was used as a proxy for role-based access.

## 📈 Dashboard Pages
1. **Executive Overview** – High-level KPIs and loan grade analysis  
2. **Risk & Segmentation Analysis** – Borrower behavior and risk distribution  
3. **Time Series & What-if Analysis** – Trend and scenario-based insights  

---

## ☁️ Publication
The dashboard was published to **Power BI Service** and shared with stakeholders using role-based access and collaboration features.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Credit Risk Analysis** solution using Power BI. By combining DAX calculations, interactive dashboards, what-if analysis, and security features, the project supports data-driven decision making in credit risk management.
